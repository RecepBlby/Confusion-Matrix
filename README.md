# Confusion Matrix

In Machine Learning, you frame the problem, collect and clean the data, add some necessary feature variables(if any), train the model, measure its performance, improve it by using some cost function, and then it is ready to deploy. But how do we measure its performance? Is there any particular feature to look at?

There are plenty of ways to gauge the performance of your classification model but none have stood the test of time like the confusion matrix. It helps us evaluate how our model performed, where it went wrong and offers us guidance to correct our path.
